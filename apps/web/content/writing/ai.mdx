Giving developers AI is like giving someone a supercar and starting them in a traffic jam. Tell them to floor it and you don't get to your desination faster, you crash.

A strong developer with these AI skills can already ship what a team of a dozen can do today. Velocity is compounding, not incremental.

The question becomes... "Are your systems, orgs, proecessed ready to handle that kind of output?"

You don't need a faster car. You need a better road system, highways. Paths with fewer red lights, smoother lanes, and more autonomy. Otherwise, AI acceleration will just amplify the existing problems.

**Code isn't the bottleneck, I don't believe it ever was, and AI will prove it.**

## Culture first, not tool first

Top-down mandates stall. Bottom-up adoption sticks. I'm a firm believer that transformation starts with culture, not edicts. If you are not familiar with the Law of Diffusion of Innovation, it is probably more relevant today than ever...

![Law of Diffusion of Innovation](/ai/innovation.png)

Innovators and early adopters spark the movement, not exec directives targeting the entire population. Developers need space and autonomy to experiment, push their curiousity, test boundaries, and see how it can apply in practice. Instead of "mandate Co-pilot" and tracking usages, create a culture where using it is obvious, helpful, and celebrated. Real transformation is viral not scheduled.

### What NOT to do

Don't retrofit or sprinkle AI into your existing broken systems & processes. You will only amplify the dysfunction. Instead, re-architect for an AI-first ecosystem. Do you need those? What benefits do they offer, are they fast enough? What could it look like without them? Start with small teams and trust. Demand MORE of your systems.

## Dev excellence is the catalyst

Code is becoming a commodity, it is cheap, AI can write it faster than any dev can.

The new premium and value is on having good:

- **Product Sense** - Knowing what to build and why, not just how
- **Taste & Judgement** - Making good decisions, FAST, on limited information, UX, architecture, tradeoffs
- **Generalist Knowldedge** - Seeing and buiding the whole system with AI, not just a a small piece of the puzzle

Devs who can go from idea to shiped product end-to-end with good taste will get the biggest ROI from building with AI. The bottlneck isn't code, it's vision and ownership.

### What could be stopping them?

- Silos
- Budgeting and planning
- Manual/slow processes
- Batched deployment cycles
- Indefinite internal dependencies (aka. Micro-service Hell)

## Conway's Law is not only true, but one of the biggest blockers

> "Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."

- Melvin Conway

If you are organized around silos, your software will be siloed. AI's efficiency, speed, and consistency comes to a hard stop when operating in silos (multi-app, separated code & teams). Can you still get some AI gains within the silos? Sure. But there is now a finite cap on that ROI, even in a world of instant code, the comms, dependencies, politics, and meetings between the teams becomes your bottneck, your chaos.

Organize teams around outcomes not departments/stacks.

### Micro-services & micro-frontends are a paradox to building with AI

I've always been hesitant towards the "micro" trends and isolating teams/code for maximum re-use and consistency. I mean I understood it's benefits and why especially large orgs and enterprises went head first into this model, but I was never too convinced on the tradeoffs of developer experience and velocity. Idk why, but in my mind I've always just thought the more dependencies you have the less you will be able to get done, this goes for anything in life. You gotta move and waiting on that one friend to help you?...yeah you may be waiting awhile or your schedules don't align, or you gotta bribe them with pizza and beers and sell it as fun! But, if you can move by yourself somehow, you can do it immediately. Especially for CRUD operations, and now... AI can basically do in its sleep. The pro-consistency or common services for everyone to leverage just didnt click for me as being worth it and is more true now than ever.
